# Running the System in a Dev Container

This project uses [Dev Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) to create an isolated and fully configured development environment.

## How to Run the Container

Follow these simple steps to start the system:

1. **Open the project in VS Code**  
   Make sure you have the _Remote - Containers_ extension installed.

2. **Start the container**  
   Run the following command in VS Code:
   > **Dev Containers: Reopen in Container**
   
   This will start the container using the configurations defined in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`.

## Accessing the GUI

Once the container is running, you can access the graphical interface by opening your browser and navigating to:

[http://localhost:6080/](http://localhost:6080/)

This will allow you to interact with the application running inside the container.
